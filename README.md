# Project3

Name of team members
One paragraph description of the system behavior (what does it do?)
Design Alternatives section with explanation of choice of servo motors
Summary of testing results. Create a table from the list of project behaviors for the two subsystems to organize the results. Fill in “Pass or Fail” for each behavior, and provide comments where necessary. This will be similar to Project 2. 
*Extra credit (+3 points) if a correct modular diagram of the code (similar to Figure 5.3 in textbook) is linked or included in the readme file.
